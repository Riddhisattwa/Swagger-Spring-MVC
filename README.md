Implementing Swagger2 with Spring MVC Application with Java Based Configuration
The following project is based on a spring MVC application given at:https://www.boraji.com/spring-4-mvc-hello-world-example
I have implemented Swagger2 in the project and tested it! It works like Spring Boot Application running Swagger2! 

To do:
1>git clone https://github.com/Riddhisattwa/Swagger-Spring-MVC.git

3> Add server->Apache Tomcat 8,8.5,9
4>Run as->Maven clean
5>Run as->Maven install
6->Run as Server

To run Swagger2 with the project follow normal Swagger2 method.
